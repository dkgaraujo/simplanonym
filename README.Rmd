The goal of simplanonym is to easily anonymise individuals that appear in multiple datasets, in a consistent way. 

Consistent anonymisation means that:

* each unique individual gets the same single anonymised factor, even if appearing in more than one dataset;
* the same anonymised factor always refers back to the same individual.

## Installation

You can install the development version of simplanonym from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dkgaraujo/simplanonym")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(simplanonym)

rand_tbl_1 <- vroom::gen_tbl(10, 4, col_types = "fffd")
rand_tbl_2 <- vroom::gen_tbl(10, 2, col_types = "fd")
rand_tbl_2$X3 <- rand_tbl_1$X3

# note:
# * rand_tbl_1 and rand_tbl_2 share three column names,
#   of which X2 is a factor in one but not the other.
# * X1 factors do not overlap, but their anonymisation
#   should still be consistent (ie, different levels should
#   have their own unique anonymised factors).
# * For X3, the anonymised factors should consider the levels
#   at both `rand_tbl_1$X3` and `rand_tbl_2$X3`.

data_list <- list(rand_tbl_1, rand_tbl_2)
data_list

data_list |> anonymise(return_original_levels = TRUE)
```
